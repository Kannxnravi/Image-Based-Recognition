# Image-Baset-Recognition-
Using Dogs and Cats


In this, you will build a convolutional neural network from scratch to classify images into two categories, dog or cat, with a 92% accuracy.

We're not going to use transfer learning this time (so no cheating!), and I will explain in details the process I followed to solve this classic problem.

You will learn how to:

build and tune a convolutional network with keras for image classification
choose the right optimizer to make sure that your network is able to learn
use the keras ImageDataGenerator to augment your dataset and limit overfitting
